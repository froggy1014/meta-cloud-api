# Agent Notes

- Keep payloads plain. Avoid functional-style builders or complex compositions.
- Follow the API examples index in `docs/README.md` for usage references.
- Prefer official WhatsApp Business Platform docs when updating API behavior.
- Keep changes in small commits with concise messages.
- Run `pnpm test` and `pnpm build` when touching core APIs.
